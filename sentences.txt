 Being human makes us susceptible to the onset of feelings. 
 The role of these emotions varies. Some of them are useful while others may be harmful.
 The use of social media for self-expression has reached a point that it makes us feel we can say anything. 
 This begins when we see people expressing anything and everything that come to mind.
 When we see everyone else voicing their likes and dislikes, their irritations and desires we tend to imitate what they do.
